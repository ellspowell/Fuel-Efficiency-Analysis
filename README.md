# Fuel-Efficiency-Analysis
This data analysis uses the built-in mtcars dataset in R. This analysis focuses on the relationship between vehicle weight (wt) and miles per gallon (mpg) and to determine whether there is a significant association through exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics.

### Data Dictionary 
Mtcars is a built-in data set within R containing data collected from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine. It is a dataframe containing 32 observations of 11 numeric variables:
 - mpg, Miles per (US) gallon
 - cyl, Number of cylinders
 - disp, Displacement (cu. in.)
 - hp, Gross horsepower
 - drat, Rear axle ratio
 - wt, Weight (1000lbs)
 - qsec, 1/4 mile time
 - vs, Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = Straight)
 - am, Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
 - gear, Number of forward gears
 - carb, Number of carburetors

### Objective 
The objective of this analysis is to determine whether the fuel efficiency (mpg) is significantly associated to vehicle weight (wt) using exploratory data analysis, visualisations, correlation analysis, and linear regression. 

### Tools and Visualisations Used
- Language: R
- Packages: ggplot2
- Types of visualisations:
  - Boxplot
  - Scatterplot with regression line
